## Contribution

You can follow the standard pull request workflow: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project

Or, since this is a very small project with few contributors, you can also send me your code through any mean (the forum for example) and I'll find a way to merge it.
